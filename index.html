        <p class="main-info">For nearly the past 40 years, 
                             the movies have captivated us. 
                             At Movie Mania, we have thousands 
                               of horror films available for screening on demand, 
                               24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
                              Scroll through some of the 
                              greatest Horror movies made in the last 40 years. 
                              Perhaps the most obvious reason why horror films are so popular is because
                              people like to watch  them at Halloween.  At a time when everyone is talking about ghost, witches and 
                              unexplained occurences, people like to put on a horror DVD and get in the spirit.
